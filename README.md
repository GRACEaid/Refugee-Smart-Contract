**Refugee Smart Contract
**
Awareness on the global refugee issues seems to be adequate but due to the nature of the problem being constant people tend to forget.
This is a contract that attempts 3 items in one go:
1. Raise awareness in the GIT/Crypto/Ethereum Community and further afield.
2. Give someone a space where they can donate time rather than money in order to get the contract and it's requirements nailed down.
3. Create a movement where small charitable organisations struggling for money will get free transaction costs, free development time and perhaps an expanded audience that will help by donating crypto, fiat, items, time(like online or in person) etc.

**1. Raise awareness** :There are several charities around the world dealing with the global refugee crisis. Most of them are larger established organisations      with lots of expenses and salaried staff.
We aim to give priority to the opposite side of the spectrum.
**"100% Voluntary, 100% grass roots"** is our aim.
All charities we deal with are 100% run by volunteers in the spare time (or full time) and are 100% grass roots teams(normal people like    you - not professionals in the sector).
By writting the first smart contract on the issue we aim to raise awareness with all online and technology communities.

**2. We are first of looking  for Ethereum** ecosystem developers and experts to provide a strategy and timeline for the first ever refugee related smart contract.
We don't want money...we want your time. Badly. Read on for the idea and if you like start writting...:)


**3. Refugee Contract by GRACEaid - FREE charitableTransactions**
Through our collaboration with GiVETH(giveth.io) we have found that transaction costs are prohibitive for charitable donations in the Ethereum main network.
This gave us the idea to create a movement so that:
a)Voluntary, grass roots, charities(yup registered ones for now UK first, then Europe, then US) will be able to verify themselves(we need to know your status from a different source than you) and after  that be able to receive gas free donations on the Ethereum network but also ALL other networks.
b)You can donate whatever "type" of time you have! Development, strategy, fundraising etc. Time...nothing else.
We want this project to operate a 100% voluntary and 100% grass roots model and this is the only way forward.
Your name will be added to the team and...yes you will be able to get verified through a certificate on the blockchain(this will be done through a separate verification method)




If you really don't have any time but have lots of money....well read on...
